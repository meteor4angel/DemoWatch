Certainly! Here's a list of interview questions for hiring a Senior .NET Developer along with sample answers:

Explain the differences between var and dynamic in C#.

Answer: var is implicitly typed and resolved at compile-time, while dynamic is resolved at runtime. Use var when the type is evident during compile-time, and use dynamic when the type is determined at runtime.
Describe the purpose of the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) in .NET.

Answer: The GAC is a shared location for storing and managing .NET assemblies that are intended to be globally accessible by multiple applications. It facilitates versioning and sharing of common libraries across different applications.
Explain the concept of dependency injection and how it's implemented in .NET.

Answer: Dependency injection is a design pattern where dependencies are injected into a class rather than being created within the class. In .NET, this is often achieved through constructor injection, property injection, or method injection. It promotes loose coupling and testability.
How do you handle exceptions in .NET applications, and what is the purpose of try-catch blocks?

Answer: Try-catch blocks are used to handle exceptions in .NET. The code inside the try block is monitored, and if an exception occurs, it's caught by the catch block. This allows developers to gracefully handle errors, log information, and prevent the application from crashing.
Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using asynchronous programming in .NET.

Answer: Asynchronous programming in .NET improves scalability and responsiveness by allowing non-blocking execution of code. It's beneficial for I/O-bound operations. Drawbacks include increased complexity and potential for harder-to-debug code due to the asynchronous nature.
Discuss the differences between abstract classes and interfaces in C#.

Answer: Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces only have method signatures. A class can inherit from only one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces. Abstract classes can have access modifiers for their members, while interfaces cannot.
How do you ensure the security of a .NET application, especially when dealing with sensitive user data?

Answer: Security measures include validating user inputs, using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, encrypting sensitive data, implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, and staying updated on security best practices and patches.
Discuss your approach to unit testing and how it contributes to the overall quality of your code.

Answer: Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions in isolation. It helps identify bugs early, ensures code reliability during changes, and improves maintainability. A good approach includes writing testable code, creating comprehensive test cases, and automating tests in the development process.
Explain the Entity Framework, and how does it differ from ADO.NET?

Answer: Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with objects rather than raw SQL. ADO.NET is a lower-level data access technology that involves working directly with datasets, data readers, and SQL commands.
How would you optimize the performance of a .NET application?

Answer: Performance optimization involves various strategies such as using efficient algorithms, caching, optimizing database queries, minimizing network calls, using asynchronous programming, and profiling code to identify bottlenecks. Regular monitoring and profiling tools help in identifying areas for improvement.
Remember, these answers provide a starting point, and the depth of the responses may vary based on the candidate's experience and expertise. It's also important to tailor the questions to align with the specific technologies and practices used at Humana.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some technical interview questions for hiring a Senior .NET Developer along with sample answers:

Explain the differences between ArrayList and List<T> in C#.

Answer: ArrayList is a non-generic collection, whereas List<T> is a generic collection introduced in .NET 2.0. List<T> provides type safety, better performance, and is preferable when working with a specific type.
What is the purpose of the using statement in C#?

Answer: The using statement is used for automatic resource management, primarily for releasing unmanaged resources like files or database connections. It ensures that the resource is properly disposed of when it goes out of scope.
Explain the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.

Answer: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. This can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding. It enhances flexibility and maintainability in code.
How does garbage collection work in .NET, and what is the purpose of the Finalize method?

Answer: Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The Finalize method is used for cleanup operations before an object is garbage collected. However, it's recommended to use the IDisposable pattern and the Dispose method for resource cleanup.
Explain the SOLID principles and how they apply to C# development.

Answer: SOLID stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. They guide developers to create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software by promoting modular and loosely coupled code.
Discuss the benefits of using the async and await keywords in C#.

Answer: async and await enable asynchronous programming in C#, allowing non-blocking execution of code. This is particularly useful for tasks like I/O operations. It enhances the responsiveness of applications by preventing them from being blocked during long-running operations.
How does the Entity Framework handle database migrations, and what is Code-First vs. Database-First approach?

Answer: Entity Framework Code-First allows developers to define the data model using classes, and migrations are used to create or update the database schema based on changes in the model. Database-First, on the other hand, involves generating the model from an existing database.
Discuss the differences between value types and reference types in C#.

Answer: Value types directly store their data, and changes to one instance don't affect others (e.g., int, struct). Reference types store references to the data, and changes to one instance affect all references (e.g., class, string).
How do you handle exceptions in a .NET application, and what is the purpose of try-catch blocks?

Answer: Exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks. The try block contains code that might throw an exception, and the catch block specifies how to handle the exception. It ensures graceful handling of errors and prevents application crashes.
Explain the purpose and usage of the yield keyword in C#.

Answer: The yield keyword is used in iterator methods to create an iterator block. It allows the developer to iterate over a collection without loading the entire collection into memory, improving performance and resource utilization.
These questions and answers provide a starting point for assessing the technical skills of a Senior .NET Developer. Depending on the specific requirements at Humana, you may want to tailor the questions accordingly.
