Tell me about yourself

First of all, let me thank you for giving me the opprtunitry to be interviewed for this position. My name is Joyce and I'm a .Net web developer with over 10 years of working experience. 

Over the years I worked on different industries, environmenst which requires me to be collabrative and adaptative   while working on different team.

In my last project, I worked as a senior .net developer and I was responsible in overseeing a team of junior developers. I was not the designated team lead, however, on the team where I belong I was the most senior developer, and I did all I could to mentor, help on technical issues ecnounreted, advise on best practise and delegate  tasks to the members of our team, assist on tasks to be completed on schedule

I descrivbe myself as as as  flexible, accountable and commited to my team and to my job.


And I;m very excited to bring my experise to your company and help drive success.

My greatest strength is that - I love my team, anywhere I go.
I would offer help everytime to my team members even if they don't ask, I also sometimes
do secret help to my members. I like seeing them be complemented and praised fro their job well done, well it may be a team effort but the extreme happiness they share or exude motivates me to stay grounded, and makes me feel proud of them.

My weakness - is that I love to learn more. I'd like to keep on learning.
When I'm immobilize or I feel that I'm not learning anything new - it makes me feel sad and stagnant.
